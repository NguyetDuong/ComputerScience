    //
    // But that's not all!

    // You will need to create at least one additional class for WeirdList
    // to work. This is because you are forbidden from using any of the
    // following in ANY of the code for HW3 (we won't actually check,
    // but, you're depriving yourself of a cool problem if you do):
    //       if, switch, while, for, do, try, or the ?: operator.

    // I do not expect you to necessarily know where to even start.
    // If you'd like an obtuse hint, scroll to the very bottom of this
    // file.

    // You can create this hypothetical class (or classes) in separate
    // files like you usually od, or if you're feeling bold you can
    // actually stick them INSIDE of this class. Yes, nested classes
    // are a thing in Java.

    // As an example:
    // private static class Potato {
    //    int n;
    //    public Potato(int nval) {
    //       n = nval;
    //    }
    // }
    //
    // The above would define a class that lives inside WeirdList.
    // You are NOT required to do this, just an extra thing you can
    // do if you want to avoid making a separate .java file.
