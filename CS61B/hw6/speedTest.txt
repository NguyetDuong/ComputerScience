Results for InsertRandomSpeedTest:
A lot of my inputs came out to be 0s. However when
I neared ~1000, I get around 0.02s for linked-list sets.


Results for InsertInOrderSpeedTest:
Everything I input comes out to be 0s.
Except for linked-list set, which finally reached 0.01s 
when I got to around 100. 



Explain anything interesting that you might have observed above:
The biggest reason I have for my BSTStringSet to be 0 is that I may not have 
written the code correctly. Linked-list, however seems to be the exception between
the three that is created. For the TreeSet, it appears how they make it creates more
efficient branches than linked-list. It may be because all of linked-lists branches are
created one by one while TreeSets can create two?
