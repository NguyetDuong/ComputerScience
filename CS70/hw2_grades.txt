#Problem 1.a: 10 
#Problem 1.b: 10 [deviating] 
#Problem 1.c: 10 [deviating] 
#Problem 1.d: 10 [deviating] 
#Problem 2.a: 10 
#Problem 2.b: 10 
#Problem 2.c: 10 
#Problem 2.d: 10 
#Problem 2.e: 10 
#Problem 2.f: 10 
#Problem 2.g: 10 
#Problem 3.a: 10 
#Problem 3.b: 10 
#Problem 4: 10 
#Problem 5: 8 Did not actually use the variable 8 and did not show what a_k really is.
#Problem 6.a: 10 
#Problem 6.b: 10 
#Problem 7: 10 [deviating] 
#Problem 8: 8 [deviating] I did not really make a claim but rather I stuck it into my hypothesis. The thought process was all correct but I did not make way to prove how I came to the conclusion of the equation but rather just showed cases.
#Problem 9: 0
