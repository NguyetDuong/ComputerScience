\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Elevator}
  
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item 
		The probability of the elevator stopping at all on floor 3 means that at least one of the eight people in the elevator will get off. Every single person on the elevator has a $\frac{1}{10}$ probability of getting off on floor 3, because there is 10 floors total. This means the probability that it stops on floor 3, is all of these probability combined. Therefore, the probability of the elevator stopping on floor three is $\frac{8}{10} \approx 0.8$. 
    
      \item 
		$1 * \frac{1}{10} + 2 * \frac{1}{10} + 3 * \frac{1}{10} + 4 * \frac{1}{10} + 5 * \frac{1}{10} + 6 * \frac{1}{10} + 7 * \frac{1}{10} + 8 * \frac{1}{10} + 9 * \frac{1}{10} + 10 * \frac{1}{10} = 5.5$
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
  
  \newpage
  \item \textbf{Soulmates}

  For this, we know that the probability of a man's top woman also has him as the top of her list is $\frac{1}{n}$. We also know that there are n-instances of this. Therefore, our answer would be 1 since it is the addition of all the probability of chances if this happening with every man. Since there are n men, we add the fraction n times.
