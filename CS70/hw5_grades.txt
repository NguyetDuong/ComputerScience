#Problem 1: 10 [deviating] 
#Problem 2.a: 10 
#Problem 2.b: 10 
#Problem 2.c: 10 I did a lot of guess and check for this lol...
#Problem 2.d: 10 
#Problem 2.e: 10 
#Problem 3.a: 10 [deviating] It looks somewhat similar? Except maybe I went backwards? The proving it is distinct is very alike. 
#Problem 3.b: 8 [deviating] I felt like my answer works... I don't know lol.
#Problem 4: 10 
#Problem 5.a: 10 [deviating] I did it very differently but I think it works. The only maybe not the same is part C of this where I did a different approach that might not be necessarily correct?
#Problem 5.b: 5 [deviating]  I didn't prove it by induction but it was sort of induction? 
#Problem 6: 8 Left out the run time. 
#Problem 7: 8 [deviating] To me it feels very similar yet I worded it very different. But I feel as though the idea is still there.
