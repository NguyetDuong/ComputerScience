        EXERCISE 1
===========================
1. .data, .word, .text are used to give instructions to the assembler but not the machines
2. break right before 14 will allow us to set a break -- jk this doesn't work. After we assemble, we can Toggle-Breakpoints, and from there, checkmark the line we want to break at. 
3. If we want to continue running the program we just press next.
4. 34 gets printed. It is 9th Fib number
5. The number 9 is stored in the address 0x10010010
6. This means we have to find in the data segment the address above, and change it manually to the correct number we want (in hex)
7. To view the contents in the register, just look at the registers for the list of items inside of it. There, we change the number 9 (in hex) to 13 in hex. 
8. syscall is mainly called for outputs and inputs. We'd call it by loading the service number in register $v0 and then load any argument is necessary then finally call the syscall.
